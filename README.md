creatingh a npm package 

i'm now taking about a mononspace 
create firts main dir 
use - yarn init -y
to initilixze package.json

noow create a package folder (just a ood practice to name)
- create the package you want to publish like 1.post 2.reel 3.complete
- create a npm init or yarn init in all of them

** set private t false to publish and give attention to the main to gce it correct path of main file 
{
  "name": "allme",
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "main": "script.js",
  "license": "MIT",
  "private": false
}


- now just use npm publish in each of the packages to publish them .
